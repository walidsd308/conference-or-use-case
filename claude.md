# Scientific Writing Skill

## Core Principles

Scientific writing prioritizes precision, clarity, and reproducibility. Every sentence must convey exact meaning without ambiguity.

## Language Standards

### Voice and Tense

- Use active voice for clarity: "We measured temperature" not "Temperature was measured"
- Past tense for methods and results: "Participants completed the survey"
- Present tense for established facts: "Water boils at 100°C"
- Future tense only for proposed work in grants or protocols

### Precision Requirements

- Define technical terms at first use
- Use SI units with appropriate significant figures
- Specify exact quantities: "15 mL" not "some solution"
- State statistical tests with parameters: "t(24) = 2.31, p = 0.029"
- Report confidence intervals: "mean = 4.2 (95% CI: 3.8–4.6)"

### Prohibited Patterns

**Vague quantifiers:** Replace "a lot," "many," "some," "few" with exact numbers or ranges.

**Hedging excess:** Limit hedging words (may, might, possibly, perhaps) to one per paragraph maximum.

**Redundancies:** Eliminate phrases like "in order to" (use "to"), "the reason is because" (use "because"), "during the course of" (use "during").

**Filler phrases:** Remove "it is important to note that," "it should be mentioned," "as a matter of fact."

## Structural Components

### Abstract (150–300 words)

Structure: Background (1–2 sentences) → Objective → Methods → Results → Conclusion

Include primary quantitative findings. Avoid citations and abbreviations except universally known ones.

### Introduction

Funnel structure: broad context → specific gap → research question → hypothesis

Final paragraph states objectives and briefly outlines approach.

### Methods

Write for exact replication. Include:
- Materials with catalog numbers and vendors
- Equipment with model numbers
- Software with versions
- Statistical methods with justification for test selection
- Sample size calculation or rationale
- Ethical approvals with protocol numbers

### Results

Report findings without interpretation. Present in logical sequence matching methods. Lead each paragraph with the main finding, then supporting data.

### Discussion

Structure: Summary of key findings → Interpretation in context of literature → Limitations → Implications → Future directions

Address each stated objective. Compare findings explicitly to prior studies.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any scientific document:

1. **Terminology consistency:** Same concept uses same term throughout
2. **Acronym discipline:** Defined at first use, used consistently after
3. **Parallel structure:** Lists and comparisons use matching grammatical forms
4. **Transition logic:** Each paragraph connects to the previous
5. **Claim support:** Every assertion links to data or citation
6. **Figure references:** All figures and tables cited in text in order

## Common Error Prevention

### Spelling and Terminology

- Verify spelling of species names (italicized genus and species)
- Check chemical nomenclature against IUPAC standards
- Confirm gene symbols follow organism-specific conventions
- Use journal-specific spelling (e.g., "behaviour" vs "behavior")

### Phrase Repetition Avoidance

Track key terms per section. If a word appears more than three times in one paragraph, find synonyms or restructure:

| Overused | Alternatives |
|----------|-------------|
| significant | substantial, notable, meaningful, appreciable |
| important | critical, essential, key, fundamental |
| showed | demonstrated, revealed, indicated, established |
| used | employed, applied, utilized, implemented |
| increased | elevated, enhanced, augmented, rose |

### Subject-Verb Agreement

Watch for collective nouns: "The data show" (plural), "The committee has decided" (singular when acting as unit).

## Citation Integration

Integrate citations as evidence, not filler:

**Weak:** "Studies have been done on this topic (Smith 2020; Jones 2021; Lee 2022)."

**Strong:** "Elevated cortisol correlates with reduced hippocampal volume (Smith 2020), though this relationship attenuates with age (Jones 2021)."

## Formatting Conventions

- Numbers one through nine spelled out; 10+ as numerals
- Exception: Always use numerals with units (5 mg, 3 days)
- Use en-dash for ranges: pages 10–15, 2020–2024
- Hyphenate compound modifiers: "well-established method" but "the method is well established"
