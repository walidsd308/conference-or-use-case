Operating room (OR) scheduling prioritizes operational efficiency over patient preferences. This study introduces a patient-centered scheduling framework developed for the orthopedic department at the university hospital of Montpellier (France) (Hôpital Lapeyronie). Formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), the model balances strict resource constraints with patient autonomy. Unlike static systems, this approach generates a set of optimized, feasible time slots, allowing patients to select their preferred surgery date. An iterative scheduling heuristic prioritizes flexible patients to preserve choice for constrained ones. Benchmarks using real-world data show that the framework increases utilization by 23 percentage points in weeks 1--2. This decision-support tool integrates operational targets with patient engagement, demonstrating that efficiency and satisfaction complement each other.
