abstract = {This paper investigates the Adaptive Allocation Scheduling Problem with a modified block scheduling policy, in which candidate patients have to be assigned and sequenced into operating room blocks, taking into consideration unanticipated events or disruptions (e.g., arrivals of non-elective patients). A post disruption management approach is considered to tackle the disruptions. In this regard, a mixed-integer linear programming model with multiple objectives including minimization of patients’ cancellation, patients’ tardiness, block overtime, idleness of surgeons, and minimizing the start time of emergency patient’s surgery is proposed. A solution approach consisting of a column-generation-based heuristic algorithm and a Benders’ decomposition technique is developed to solve the model. The efficiency of the formulation and the solution approach is examined through numerical experiments based on hospital records. It is shown that the developed solution approach outperforms the untutored column generation method and is capable of finding close to optimal solutions significantly faster than the standard Benders’ decomposition method.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the advance scheduling of elective surgeries in an operating theater composed of operating rooms and a downstream surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The arrivals of new patients in each week, the duration of each surgery, and the length-of-stay of each patient in the SICU are subject to uncertainty. At the end of each week, the surgery planner determines the surgical blocks to open in the next week and assigns a subset of the surgeries on the waiting list to open surgical blocks. The objective is to minimize the patient-related costs incurred by performing and postponing surgeries as well as the hospital-related costs caused by utilization of surgical resources. Considering that the pure mathematical programming models commonly used in the literature mostly focus on the short-term optimization of surgery schedules, we propose a novel two-phase optimization model that combines Markov decision process (MDP) and stochastic programming to improve the long-term performance of surgery schedules. Moreover, in order to solve realistically sized problems efficiently, we develop a novel column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) algorithm, then combine it with the sample average approximation (SAA) approach. The experimental results indicate that the SAA-CGBH algorithm is considerably more efficient than the conventional SAA approach, and that the optimal surgery schedules of the two-phase optimization model significantly outperform those of a pure stochastic programming model.}

abstract = {Surgery groups are clustered surgery procedure types that share comparable characteristics (e.g. expected duration). Scheduling OR blocks leaves many options for operational surgery scheduling and this increases the variation in usage of both the OR and downstream beds. Therefore, we schedule surgery groups to reduce the options for operational scheduling, ultimately bridging the gap between tactical and operational scheduling. We propose a single step mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach that approximates the bed and OR usage and a simulated annealing approach. Both approaches are compared on a real-life data set and results show that the MILP performs best in terms of solution quality and computation time. Furthermore, the results show that our model may improve the OR utilization from 71% to 85% and decrease the bed usage variation from 53 beds to 11 beds compared to historical data. To show the potential and robustness of our model, we discuss several variants of the model requiring minor modifications. The use of surgery groups makes it easier to implementation our model in practice and, for operational planners, it is instantly clear where to schedule different types of surgery.}

abstract = {While timely emergency OR access is strictly required in many specialties, this paper provides a highly responsive preventive-reactive scheduling procedure to address emergency arrivals with waiting time limits before and on surgery day with no assumption on the emergency arrival patterns. To improve responsiveness in situations where existing break-in-moments-based scheduling does not perform well, a MIP model is first developed to generate initial schedules by making ex-ante preparations for future possible arrivals with the objective of minimizing the sacrifice in the throughput of elective surgeries. For applicability, two additional heuristics, which are derived from the MIP model but include other scheduling ideas, are also designed for preventive scheduling. Furthermore, as a supplement to preventive scheduling, a corresponding reactive scheduling method is designed to be applied on surgery day. Facing different emergency realizations, it provides effective and satisfactory adjustments on surgery day by scheduling arrived emergencies timely, properly updating the remaining schedule to prepare for subsequent arrivals with consideration of minimizing the adjusting impact on scheduled elective cases. The effectiveness and performances of the proposed procedures and heuristics are evaluated in comparison with traditional preventive and reactive scheduling strategies through simulations and statistical tests. The numerical results show that the methods developed in this study can significantly improve the responsiveness with an acceptable sacrifice in OR utilization and can provide satisfactory schedules for both types of patients. Some scheduling guidelines based on simulation results and the applicability of the proposed scheduless are also discussed at the end of this study.}

In this article, we study the problem of scheduling surgeries for multiple ORs and induction rooms (IR) that function based on the parallel processing principle under uncertainty. We propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model considering the uncertainty in induction, surgery and turnover durations. We sequence patients and set appointment times for surgeries in the first stage and assign patients to IRs at the second stage of the model. We show that an optimal myopic policy can be used for IR assignment decisions due to the special structure of the model. We minimize the expected total cost of patient waiting time, OR idle time and IR idle time in the objective function. We enhance the model formulation using bounds on variables and symmetry-breaking constraints. We implement a novel progressive hedging algorithm by proposing a penalty update method and a variable fixing mechanism. Based on real data of a large academic hospital, we compare our solution approach with several scheduling heuristics from the literature. We assess the additional benefits and costs associated with the implementation of parallel processing using near-optimal schedules. We examine how the benefits are inflated by increasing the number of IRs. Finally, we estimate the value of stochastic solution to underline the importance of considering uncertainty in durations.}

@article{Spratt2019,
   abstract = {In this paper, we address the multiple operating room (OR) surgical case sequencing problem (SCSP). The objective is to maximise total OR utilisation during standard opening hours. This work uses a case study of a large Australian public hospital with long surgical waiting lists and high levels of non-elective demand. Due to the complexity of the SCSP and the size of the instances considered herein, heuristic techniques are required to solve the problem. We present constructive heuristics based on both a modified block scheduling policy and an open scheduling policy. A number of real-time reactive strategies are presented that can be used to maintain schedule feasibility in the case of disruptions. Results of computational experiments show that this approach maintains schedule feasibility in real-time, whilst increasing operating theatre (OT) utilisation and throughput, and reducing the waiting time of non-elective patients. The framework presented here is applicable to the real-life scheduling of OT departments, and we provide recommendations regarding implementation of the approach.},

Our model considers surgery times, intensive care unit times and post-surgery lengths of stays stochastic and accounts for the availability of both intensive care unit beds and post-surgery beds. It aims to maximise the expected operating theatre’s throughput. The assignment problem, modelled as a stochastic problem, is solved via a sample average approximation. It gets an estimate of the optimum expected throughput for each specialty and of the operating theatre. We illustrate the application of the model on a real case study with real data from a leading European Children’s Hospital, study the sensitivity of obtained results to the two-week planned grid, and highlight the importance of considering the stochastic nature of the problem.}

abstract = {We study the elective surgery planning problem in a hospital with operating rooms shared by elective and emergency patients. This problem is split in two distinct phases. First, a subset of patients to be operated in the next planning period is selected and the selected patients are assigned to a block and a tentative starting time. Then, in the online phase of the problem, a policy decides how to insert the emergency patients in the schedule and may cancel planned surgeries. The overall goal is to minimize the expectation of a cost function representing the assignment of patient to blocks, case cancellations, overtime, waiting time and idle time. We model the offline problem by a two-stage stochastic program, and show that the optimal second-stage costs can be approximated by a convex piecewise linear surrogate model that can be computed in a preprocessing step. This results in a mixed integer program which can be solved very fast, even for large instances of the problem. We also describe a greedy policy for the online phase of the problem, and analyze the performance of our approach by comparing it to both heuristic methods or approaches relying on sampling average approximation (SAA) on a large set of benchmarking instances. Our simulations indicate that our approach can reduce the expected costs by as much as 30% compared to heuristic methods and it can solve problems with 1000 patients in about one minute, while SAA-approaches fail to obtain good solutions within 30 min on small instances.}
